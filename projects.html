<article class="project-card"><img src="assets/color_sorter.png" alt="Color Sorter Machine" class="project-thumb"><div class="proj-text"><h3>Color Sorter Machine</h3><p>Develop a high-precision color sorting system for automated separation of materials based on color.The machine typically works by passing materials (such as grains, seeds, plastics, or components) through a vision system equipped with optical sensors. These sensor capture the color information of each item and compare it with predefined standards. Based on the detected differences, the system separate defective or unwanted items from the accepted ones.</p></div></article>
<article class="project-card"><img src="assets/regenerative.png" alt="x" class="project-thumb"><div class="proj-text"><h3>Regenerative Braking System</h3><p>Designed for EVs, optimized with ML-based strategies to maximize energy recovery.A Regenerative Braking System (RBS) improves efficiency by converting a vehicle’s kinetic energy into electrical energy during braking, which is stored in the battery for later use. This not only extends the driving range and reduces fuel consumption but also lowers brake wear, cutting maintenance costs. Additionally, it supports eco-friendly transportation by minimizing energy wastage and reducing emissions.</p></div></article>
